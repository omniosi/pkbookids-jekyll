			<p>We’re excited to introduce you to our amazing new baby and children’s accessories line!</p>
			<p>Founders Pam Shiu and Kelley Carter met almost a decade ago while working in the fashion industry in New York City. They instantly connected over their shared love of fine craftsmanship. Building on their diverse backgrounds in marketing, business management and studio arts, they started collaborating on a charming hand-knit baby brand and decided to turn their passion into a business of their own. Introducing the arrival of pkboo!</p>
			<h2>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h2>
			<p>It’s simple. We believe items that are made by hand are crafted with a sense of love, enthusiasm and attention to detail. We wouldn’t be satisfied by developing another mass-produced item. We believe functional should still be fashionable. Our thoughtful design and unexpected twists create products that feel truly unique!</p>
